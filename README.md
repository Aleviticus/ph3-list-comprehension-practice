# List Comprehension Practice

## Getting Started

Fork and clone the repository. Be sure to `cd` into the repository and run `pipenv install` and `pipenv shell`.

You have tests available with `pytest` or `pytest -x`.

Deliverables have been written as comments near each of the functions you'll be working on in `lib/index.py`.

## Issues

If you find an error or issue in the lab you may either raise an issue via github or make a pull request and inform the owner of the repository.
